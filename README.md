# Tecka
A visual clone of government's covid certification app Tečka.

The QR code does not contain a Covid certification, but rather just random data. 
It is intentionally altered (/broken) so that QR scanners don't pick them up at all
(which means that the Covid certification QR scanning app "Čtečka" should not even show a "not a covid certification QR" warning).
